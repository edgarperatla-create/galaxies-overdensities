# galaxies-overdensities
Overdenisties (2D and 3D) computing code, for large datasets of galaxies coordinates, large field areas and a wide redshift range catalogues.

The input of this code requires two txt files with coordinates (RA, Dec) for 2D overdensities computing and also redsfhift (z) for the 3D case.
The script can be run sequentially cell by cell so you can preview the different catalogues definitions and statistics while making the parameters cuts.
For this work, the observational data is read-out directly from the txt files columns, while for the simulations, it requires a readme file from which it defines the columns to be read.
